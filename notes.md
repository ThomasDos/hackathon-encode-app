Feedback on SDK Solution:

## Peanut Protocol

The addition of TypeScript support is appreciated as it enhances the overall development experience and provides better code readability and error checking.

The refactoring of the dict/map for chains has improved the code's efficiency and maintainability, making it easier to work with.

However, there seem to be issues when trying to integrate with Wagmi. It would be beneficial to address and resolve these compatibility issues to ensure smooth interoperability.

Additionally, optimizing the gas limit is crucial to improve transaction cost and overall performance. This optimization will make the SDK more appealing to developers.

Lastly, after attempting to create a link, an error was encountered - "receipt.confirmations is not a function." This issue needs to be investigated and fixed to ensure the functionality works as expected.

Overall, the SDK solution has made significant progress with valuable additions like TypeScript support and refactored data structures. However, addressing the compatibility issue with Wagmi, optimizing gas usage, and resolving the reported error will further enhance its usability and reliability.
